                <h1>Motivation Letter</h1>

                <p>Hi, my name is David, I am 17 years old․ When I was child, I was interested in computers, games and
                    computer technologies. So I decided to go that route. Because computer science is a future.
                    Now I am a student in the college.
                     <!-- You should ask me why you want to come to our company? Yes it’s a
                    great question, because I want to have more practice which is the first reason to become a great -->
                    I dont have any practice so if you have a place for inteship I will be happy to go to work․
                    I am sure that I can be realized in the field of programming, but for this I need to learn more and
                    more and more. To this motivation letter I attach a resume, which you can open in browser.
                </p>
